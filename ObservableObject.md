@ObservedObject is a property wrapper in Swift that is an essential part of the SwiftUI framework. It is used to mark objects that should be observed for changes, with these changes automatically propagated to the user interface (UI) to refresh the display. This means that when the state of an object changes, the UI is automatically updated to reflect these changes.

### Description

@ObservedObject is a key concept in SwiftUI for managing and reacting to changes in your app's data. It allows you to create reactive user interfaces that automatically update when the underlying data changes.

Here's a brief example:

```swift
import SwiftUI

class MyViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var count = 0
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = MyViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Count: \(viewModel.count)")
            Button("Increment") {
                viewModel.count += 1
            }
        }
    }
}
